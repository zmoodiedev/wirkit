## 📱 Converting to Mobile App with Capacitor

Since you requested React Native but Lovable uses React/Vite, here's how to convert this to a native mobile app:

### 1. Install Capacitor
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
```

### 2. Initialize Capacitor
```bash
npx cap init WirkIt app.wirkit.mobile
```

### 3. Build and Add Platforms
```bash
npm run build
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npx cap sync
```

### 4. Run on Device
```bash
# For iOS (requires macOS + Xcode)
npx cap run ios

# For Android (requires Android Studio)
npx cap run android
```

## 🔧 API Integration Setup

### Firebase Setup (Backend)
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore Database
3. Add your Firebase config to environment variables:
   ```js
   // src/config/firebase.js
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     // ... other config
   };
   ```

### OpenAI API Setup (ChatGPT Integration)
1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to environment variables:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
3. The chat interface is ready - just implement the actual API calls in `src/pages/Chat.tsx`

## 🔄 State Management

The app currently uses React's built-in useState and useEffect. For a production app, consider:
- **Context API** - Already set up for global state management
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **TanStack Query** - Already included for server state

## 📊 Sample Data

All pages include realistic sample data to demonstrate functionality:
- Workout logs with exercises, sets, and weights
- Meal entries with nutritional information
- Progress charts and statistics
- Planned workouts and meals
- AI chat conversations

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

1. **Implement Firebase Authentication**
   - Replace sample login/signup with real Firebase auth
   - Add user session management

2. **Set Up Firestore Database**
   - Create collections for users, workouts, meals, progress
   - Implement real CRUD operations

3. **Add OpenAI Integration**
   - Implement actual ChatGPT API calls in chat interface
   - Add speech-to-text for voice input

4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Push notifications for reminders
   - Offline functionality with local storage
   - Data synchronization between devices

5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for web version
   - Publish to App Store/Google Play for mobile
